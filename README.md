This README file covers a range of sampling techniques commonly used in machine learning models. We provide an extensive overview of the available methods, emphasizing their respective benefits and demonstrating how they can be effectively employed across various machine learning use cases. The document includes clear explanations and code snippets to guide the implementation of these techniques within popular machine learning libraries. Our primary objective is to support developers and data scientists in selecting the optimal sampling approach tailored to their particular use case, in turn enhancing the accuracy and efficacy of their machine learning models. Our thorough exploration of sampling techniques provides practitioners with the knowledge and resources necessary to produce more robust and reliable machine learning results.
